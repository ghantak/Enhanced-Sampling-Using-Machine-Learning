Steps to follow the Metadynamics Simulations of Protein Using Machine Learning ( Gaussian Process Regression) in NAMD

First Run WT metadynamics for about 30% of the estimated simulation time 

Extract the CVs and bias in a file using the python code 
Train the CVs and bias values using train_gpr_gpu.py
